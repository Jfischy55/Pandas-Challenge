This is the Written Report Section:

To summarize the analysis, Charter schools' students typically performed better than the District schools' students. Charter schools also had fewer students in total than the District schools. It's possible that the size of the school, and the type of the school may impact on the likelihood of the school having a higher percentage of their students pass in math and reading. There may be a difference in curriculum and teaching styles between Charter and Disctrict schools. This coupled with the fewer number of students, may have lead to Charter school students performing bettwer on average than the District school students. 

I couldn't quite get the int to str conversion to work towards the end summaries. I'm not exactly sure what I did incorrect and struggled to find any solutions online that wouldn't then mess up the following code. I tried to continue the assignment after not getting the str conversion to work, but haven't tested it, in order to complete the written report from the example tables given in the starter code.
